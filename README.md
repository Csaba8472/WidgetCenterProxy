# WidgetCenterProxy

Call WidgetCenter.shared methods from Xamarin.

Created it based on the [binding-swift walkthrough](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/platform/binding-swift/walkthrough).

If you run build.fat.sh you'll get WidgetCenterProxy framework, which will be used by WidgetCenterProxyBinder project. You can use WidgetCenterProxyBinder in your app to handle iOS14 widgets.
